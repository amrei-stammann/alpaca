Title: Fit glm's with high-dimensional k-way fixed effects
Version: 0.2
Authors@R: c(person("Amrei", "Stammann", email = "amrei.stammann@hhu.de", role = c("aut", "cre")), 
             person("Daniel", "Czarnowske", email = "daniel.czarnowske@hhu.de", role = c("aut")))
Description: Concentrates out factors with many levels during the optimization of the log-likelihood
  function of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm). The package is restricted to glm's 
  that are based on maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear. The package also offers an
  efficient algorithm to recover the fixed effects estimates in a post-estimation routine. It also
  includes robust and multi-way clustered standard errors.
