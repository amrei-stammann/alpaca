#' alpaca: A package for fitting glm's with high-dimensional \eqn{k}-way fixed effects
#' @description
#' Concentrates out factors with many levels during the optimization of the log-likelihood function
#' of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm). The package is restricted to glm's that are
#' based on maximum likelihood estimation. This excludes all quasi-variants of glm. The package also
#' offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a post-estimation
#' routine and includes robust and multi-way clustered standard errors. Further the package provides analytical 
#' bias corrections for binary choice models (logit and probit) derived by Fernandez-Val and 
#' Weidner (2016) and Hinz, Stammann, and Wanner (2019).
#' 
#' \strong{Note:} Linear models are also beyond the scope of this package since there is already a
#' comprehensive procedure available \link[lfe]{felm}.
