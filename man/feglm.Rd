\usage{
feglm(
  formula = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  family = binomial(),
  beta.start = NULL,
  eta.start = NULL,
  control = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"formula"}: a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.
\code{formula} must be of type \code{y ~ x | k}, where the second part of the formula refers to
factors to be concentrated out. It is also possible to pass additional variables to 
\code{\link{feglm}} (e.g. to cluster standard errors). This can be done by specifying the third 
part of the formula: \code{y ~ x | k | add}.}

\item{data}{an object of class \code{"data.frame"} containing the variables in the model.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. 
Similiar to \code{\link[stats]{glm.fit}} this has to be the result of a call to a family 
function. Default is \code{binomial()}. See \code{\link[stats]{family}} for details of family 
functions.}

\item{beta.start}{an optional vector of starting values for the structural parameters in the linear 
predictor. Default is \eqn{\boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{0}}{\beta = 0}.}

\item{eta.start}{an optional vector of starting values for the linear predictor.}

\item{control}{a named list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. See 
\code{\link{feglmControl}} for details.}
}
\value{
The function \code{\link{feglm}} returns a named list of class \code{"feglm"}.
}
\description{
\code{\link{feglm}} can be used to fit generalized linear models with many high-dimensional fixed
effects. The estimation procedure is based on unconditional maximum likelihood and can be
interpreted as a \dQuote{pseudo demeaning} approach that combines the work of Gaure (2013) and
Stammann et. al. (2016). For technical details see Stammann (2018). The routine is well suited
for large data sets that would be otherwise infeasible to use due to memory limitations.

\strong{Remark:} The term fixed effect is used in econometrician's sense of having intercepts for
each level in each category.
}
\details{
If \code{\link{feglm}} does not converge this is usually a sign of linear dependence between 
one or more regressors and a fixed effects category. In this case, you should carefully inspect 
your model specification.
