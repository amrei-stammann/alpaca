\title{alpaca: A package for fitting glm's with high-dimensional \eqn{k}-way fixed effects}
\description{
Concentrates out factors with many levels during the optimization of the log-likelihood function
of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm). The package is restricted to glm's that are
based on maximum likelihood estimation. This excludes all quasi-variants of glm. The package also
offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a post-estimation
routine and includes robust and multi-way clustered standard errors. Further the package provides analytical 
bias corrections for binary choice models (logit and probit) derived by Fernandez-Val and 
Weidner (2016) and Hinz, Stammann, and Wanner (2019).

\strong{Note:} Linear models are also beyond the scope of this package since there is already a
comprehensive procedure available \link[lfe]{felm}.
